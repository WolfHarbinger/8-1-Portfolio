For this prohject I was tasked to develop an application to create two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code.

In this project, I feel like I was able to properly understand and apply the logic of the clocks and was able to handle the math behind the clocks and user input.

I rushed this project, so I could improve on a number of things, the clocks didnt display properly only some of the functions worked, I should have been more careful in creating my constructors because admitedly there were errors there.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? Whilke this project helped me in learning how object oriented programming works in C++, I still found it challenging, but this is the project where C++ was really starting to click for me.

I will take all the things that I did worng in this project and use my improved understanding of them to help me do better in programming woth C++ in the future.
